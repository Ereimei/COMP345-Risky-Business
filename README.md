# COMP345-Risky-Business

=-=-=-=-= USEFUL INFO =-=-=-=-=

Let's keep each of our components (i.e. map, maploader, dice) as seperate netbeans projects
That allows us to write individual main.cpp files to test/demo each component
Later on we'll make a common project, and we can just import the required classes/files
to make everything work together.

Netbeans is lovely for developping C++ applications. If you've used it before for Java,
then everything will be familiar, if not, it's a very well featured IDE that is easy to pickup.

To create a new project in Netbeans select new project in top left -> C/C++ -> C/C++ application

To create a new class in Netbeans select new file -> C++ -> C++ class
***This will automatically create a header file and a cpp file

=-=-=-=-= TEMPLATE FOR BEGINING OF FILES =-=-=-=-=

You can set the template below in netbeans under Tools -> Templates -> C++
That way it will be automatically prefixed for each file you create!
Don't forget to set the assignment number

=-=-=-=-= CONVENTIONS AND BORING STUFF =-=-=-=-=

Let's just stick to Java naming conventions, since we're all familiar with that already
